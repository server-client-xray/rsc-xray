Add component-level diagnostics rendering in HTML reports

HTML reports now display error and warning diagnostics alongside suggestions:

- Component rows show combined "Issues" badges (errors, warnings, suggestions)
- Separate "Diagnostics" table shows errors/warnings with proper styling
- "Suggestions" table continues to show info-level recommendations
- Red badges for errors, orange for warnings, blue for suggestions
